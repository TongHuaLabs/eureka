# Eureka

A Git-based Collaborative Knowledge Management System powered by Obsidian

## Getting Started
### Installation

### Add a Eureka Module

The command below creates a new folder in the current folder for storing the eureka module. As a convention, folder name should be in the following format: `<two-digit-number> - <name>` (e.g. `10 - Personal`, `11 - Work`, etc.) â€” Please note that `00 - 09`  and `99` are reserved for built-in modules.

```bash
git submodule add <eureka-module-repository> <folder-name>
```
